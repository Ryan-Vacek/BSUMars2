In The Air
===========

#### The game that lets you manipulate how people are moved around!

### Game Mechanics: 
In this game, you play the manipulator, the person who changes the course in
order to keep people in the air as long as possible. There are different tools that you can choose from, and each tool has a different effect.
The longer people are in the air, the more points that you can accumlate, which allows you to buy more things, to build higher and bigger, and accumlate even more points.

### Tools included:
*Trampoline
*Slide
*Funnel
*Portals
*Pins
*Mattresses
*Glue Traps
*Fly Traps - these are sticker than glue traps
*Nets

## GAME OVER
When too many people die from your contraption, the game ends, and your score will be displayed at the end screen.

## Developer Notes:
*Each item has durability, which is how the object loses potential to continue working the same way.
*You can only place a certain amount of objects at a time, depending on how many points that you have.
*The more air time that you give the person, the more points you will get.
